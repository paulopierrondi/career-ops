## Project Local Council - Required Context

This repo has a local council overlay. It does not replace the global Product Council; it makes the global roles specific to this repo.

Before planning, editing, reviewing, testing, release, automation, Linear, secrets, UI or marketing work, read:

- `.brain/PROJECT_COUNCIL.md`
- relevant `.brain/local-agents/*.md`
- `.brain/HUB_COUNCIL_CONTEXT.md`
- `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
- `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Prompt Caching Workflow Policy.md` when available
- `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md`

Local agents are advisory role contracts, not autonomous permission grants. They inherit all hard gates from Agent Hub, Obsidian, Linear, Automation Email Policy and Security/Secrets policy.

Required local council handoff:

- local agent(s) considered;
- decision or recommendation;
- files/commands/evidence;
- risk and human gate;
- exact next action.
- prompt_cache strategy and cache telemetry when a provider exposes `cached_tokens` or equivalent.

Registry id: `career-ops`.

# Career-Ops -- AI Job Search Pipeline

## Origin

This system was built and used by [santifer](https://santifer.io) to evaluate 740+ job offers, generate 100+ tailored CVs, and land a Head of Applied AI role. The archetypes, scoring logic, negotiation scripts, and proof point structure all reflect his specific career search in AI/automation roles.

The portfolio that goes with this system is also open source: [cv-santiago](https://github.com/santifer/cv-santiago).

**It will work out of the box, but it's designed to be made yours.** If the archetypes don't match your career, the modes are in the wrong language, or the scoring doesn't fit your priorities -- just ask. You (AI Agent) can edit the user's files. The user says "change the archetypes to data engineering roles" and you do it. That's the whole point.

## Data Contract (CRITICAL)

There are two layers. Read `DATA_CONTRACT.md` for the full list.

**User Layer (NEVER auto-updated, personalization goes HERE):**
- `cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `modes/_profile.md`, `article-digest.md`, `portals.yml`
- `data/*`, `reports/*`, `output/*`, `interview-prep/*`

**System Layer (auto-updatable, DON'T put user data here):**
- `modes/_shared.md`, `modes/oferta.md`, all other modes
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `*.mjs` scripts, `dashboard/*`, `templates/*`, `batch/*`

**THE RULE: When the user asks to customize anything (archetypes, narrative, negotiation scripts, proof points, location policy, comp targets), ALWAYS write to `modes/_profile.md` or `config/profile.yml`. NEVER edit `modes/_shared.md` for user-specific content.** This ensures system updates don't overwrite their customizations.

## Update Check

On the first message of each session, run the update checker silently:

```bash
node update-system.mjs check
```

Parse the JSON output:
- `{"status": "update-available", "local": "1.0.0", "remote": "1.1.0", "changelog": "..."}` → tell the user:
  > "career-ops update available (v{local} → v{remote}). Your data (CV, profile, tracker, reports) will NOT be touched. Want me to update?"
  If yes → run `node update-system.mjs apply`. If no → run `node update-system.mjs dismiss`.
- `{"status": "up-to-date"}` → say nothing
- `{"status": "dismissed"}` → say nothing
- `{"status": "offline"}` → say nothing
- `{"status": "no-remote-version"}` → say nothing (checker reached GitHub but neither VERSION nor the latest release tag parsed as semver — treat as a silent non-failure, same as offline)

The user can also say "check for updates" or "update career-ops" at any time to force a check.
To rollback: `node update-system.mjs rollback`

## What is career-ops

AI-powered, CLI-agnostic job search automation: pipeline tracking, offer evaluation, CV generation, portal scanning, batch processing. Runs on any AI coding CLI that follows the [open agent skill standard](https://agentskills.io) (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Qwen, Copilot, Kimi).

### Main Files

| File | Function |
|------|----------|

| `reports/` | Evaluation reports (format: `{###}-{company-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`). Blocks A-F + G (Posting Legitimacy). Header includes `**Legitimacy:** {tier}`. |

### First Run — Onboarding (IMPORTANT)

**Before doing ANYTHING else, check if the system is set up.** Run these checks silently every time a session starts:

1. Does `cv.md` exist?
2. Does `config/profile.yml` exist (not just profile.example.yml)?
3. Does `modes/_profile.md` exist (not just _profile.template.md)?
4. Does `portals.yml` exist (not just templates/portals.example.yml)?

If `modes/_profile.md` is missing, copy from `modes/_profile.template.md` silently. This is the user's customization file — it will never be overwritten by updates.

**If ANY of these is missing, enter onboarding mode.** Do NOT proceed with evaluations, scans, or any other mode until the basics are in place. Guide the user step by step:

#### Step 1: CV (required)
If `cv.md` is missing, ask:
> "I don't have your CV yet. You can either:
> 1. Paste your CV here and I'll convert it to markdown
> 2. Paste your LinkedIn URL and I'll extract the key info
> 3. Tell me about your experience and I'll draft a CV for you
>
> Which do you prefer?"

Create `cv.md` from whatever they provide. Make it clean markdown with standard sections (Summary, Experience, Projects, Education, Skills).

#### Step 2: Profile (required)
If `config/profile.yml` is missing, copy from `config/profile.example.yml` and then ask:
> "I need a few details to personalize the system:
> - Your full name and email
> - Your location and timezone
> - What roles are you targeting? (e.g., 'Senior Backend Engineer', 'AI Product Manager')
> - Your salary target range
>
> I'll set everything up for you."

Fill in `config/profile.yml` with their answers. For archetypes and targeting narrative, store the user-specific mapping in `modes/_profile.md` or `config/profile.yml` rather than editing `modes/_shared.md`.

#### Step 3: Portals (recommended)
If `portals.yml` is missing:
> "I'll set up the job scanner with 45+ pre-configured companies. Want me to customize the search keywords for your target roles?"

Copy `templates/portals.example.yml` → `portals.yml`. If they gave target roles in Step 2, update `title_filter.positive` to match.

#### Step 4: Tracker
If `data/applications.md` doesn't exist, create it:
```markdown
# Applications Tracker

| # | Date | Company | Role | Score | Status | PDF | Report | Notes |
|---|------|---------|------|-------|--------|-----|--------|-------|
```

#### Step 5: Get to know the user (important for quality)

After the basics are set up, proactively ask for more context. The more you know, the better your evaluations will be:

> "The basics are ready. But the system works much better when it knows you well. Can you tell me more about:
> - What makes you unique? What's your 'superpower' that other candidates don't have?
> - What kind of work excites you? What drains you?
> - Any deal-breakers? (e.g., no on-site, no startups under 20 people, no Java shops)
> - Your best professional achievement — the one you'd lead with in an interview
> - Any projects, articles, or case studies you've published?
>
> The more context you give me, the better I filter. Think of it as onboarding a recruiter — the first week I need to learn about you, then I become invaluable."

Store any insights the user shares in `config/profile.yml` (under narrative), `modes/_profile.md`, or in `article-digest.md` if they share proof points. Do not put user-specific archetypes or framing into `modes/_shared.md`.

**After every evaluation, learn.** If the user says "this score is too high, I wouldn't apply here" or "you missed that I have experience in X", update your understanding in `modes/_profile.md`, `config/profile.yml`, or `article-digest.md`. The system should get smarter with every interaction without putting personalization into system-layer files.

#### Step 6: Ready
Once all files exist, confirm:
> "You're all set! You can now:
> - Paste a job URL to evaluate it
> - Run `/career-ops scan` (or `/career-ops-scan` if using OpenCode) to search portals
> - Run `/career-ops` to see all commands
>
> Everything is customizable — just ask me to change anything.
>
> Tip: Having a personal portfolio dramatically improves your job search. If you don't have one yet, the author's portfolio is also open source: github.com/santifer/cv-santiago — feel free to fork it and make it yours."

Then suggest automation:
> "Want me to scan for new offers automatically? I can set up a recurring scan every few days so you don't miss anything. Just say 'scan every 3 days' and I'll configure it."

If the user accepts, use the `/loop` or `/schedule` skill (if available) to set up a recurring `/career-ops scan` (or `/career-ops-scan` if using OpenCode). If those aren't available, suggest adding a cron job or remind them to run `/career-ops scan` (or `/career-ops-scan` if using OpenCode) periodically.

### Personalization

This system is designed to be customized by YOU (AI Agent). When the user asks you to change archetypes, translate modes, adjust scoring, add companies, or modify negotiation scripts -- do it directly. You read the same files you use, so you know exactly what to edit.

**Common customization requests:**
- "Change the archetypes to [backend/frontend/data/devops] roles" → edit `modes/_profile.md` or `config/profile.yml`
- "Translate the modes to English" → edit all files in `modes/`
- "Add these companies to my portals" → edit `portals.yml`
- "Update my profile" → edit `config/profile.yml`
- "Change the CV template design" → edit `templates/cv-template.html`
- "Adjust the scoring weights" → edit `modes/_profile.md` for user-specific weighting, or edit `modes/_shared.md` and `batch/batch-prompt.md` only when changing the shared system defaults for everyone

### Language Modes

Default modes are in `modes/` (English). Additional language-specific modes are available:

- **German (DACH market):** `modes/de/` — native German translations with DACH-specific vocabulary (13. Monatsgehalt, Probezeit, Kündigungsfrist, AGG, Tarifvertrag, etc.). Includes `_shared.md`, `angebot.md` (evaluation), `bewerben.md` (apply), `pipeline.md`.
- **French (Francophone market):** `modes/fr/` — native French translations with France/Belgium/Switzerland/Luxembourg-specific vocabulary (CDI/CDD, convention collective SYNTEC, RTT, mutuelle, prévoyance, 13e mois, intéressement/participation, titres-restaurant, CSE, portage salarial, etc.). Includes `_shared.md`, `offre.md` (evaluation), `postuler.md` (apply), `pipeline.md`.
- **Japanese (Japan market):** `modes/ja/` — native Japanese translations with Japan-specific vocabulary (正社員, 業務委託, 賞与, 退職金, みなし残業, 年俸制, 36協定, 通勤手当, 住宅手当, etc.). Includes `_shared.md`, `kyujin.md` (evaluation), `oubo.md` (apply), `pipeline.md`.
- **Turkish (Turkey market):** `modes/tr/` — native Turkish translations with Turkey-specific vocabulary (SGK, kıdem tazminatı, ihbar süresi, brüt/net maaş, AGİ, BES, yemek kartı, yol yardımı, TÜFE zammı, etc.). Includes `_shared.md`, `is-ilani.md` (evaluation), `basvuru.md` (apply), `pipeline.md`.

**When to use German modes:** If the user is targeting German-language job postings, lives in DACH, or asks for German output. Either:
1. User says "use German modes" → read from `modes/de/` instead of `modes/`
2. User sets `language.modes_dir: modes/de` in `config/profile.yml` → always use German modes
3. You detect a German JD → suggest switching to German modes

**When to use French modes:** If the user is targeting French-language job postings, lives in France/Belgium/Switzerland/Luxembourg/Quebec, or asks for French output. Either:
1. User says "use French modes" → read from `modes/fr/` instead of `modes/`
2. User sets `language.modes_dir: modes/fr` in `config/profile.yml` → always use French modes
3. You detect a French JD → suggest switching to French modes

**When to use Japanese modes:** If the user is targeting Japanese-language job postings, lives in Japan, or asks for Japanese output. Either:
1. User says "use Japanese modes" → read from `modes/ja/` instead of `modes/`
2. User sets `language.modes_dir: modes/ja` in `config/profile.yml` → always use Japanese modes
3. You detect a Japanese JD → suggest switching to Japanese modes

**When to use Turkish modes:** If the user is targeting Turkish-language job postings, lives in Turkey, or asks for Turkish output. Either:
1. User says "use Turkish modes" → read from `modes/tr/` instead of `modes/`
2. User sets `language.modes_dir: modes/tr` in `config/profile.yml` → always use Turkish modes
3. You detect a Turkish JD → suggest switching to Turkish modes

**When NOT to:** If the user applies to English-language roles, even at French, German, Japanese, or Turkish companies, use the default English modes — *unless* the user has explicitly requested another mode in this conversation, or `language.modes_dir` is set in `config/profile.yml` (the explicit user preference always wins over JD-language detection).

### Skill Modes

| If the user... | Mode |
|----------------|------|
| Pastes JD or URL | auto-pipeline (evaluate + report + PDF + tracker) |
| Asks to evaluate offer | `oferta` |
| Asks to compare offers | `ofertas` |
| Wants LinkedIn outreach | `contacto` |
| Asks for company research | `deep` |
| Preps for interview at specific company | `interview-prep` |
| Wants to generate CV/PDF | `pdf` |
| Evaluates a course/cert | `training` |
| Evaluates portfolio project | `project` |
| Asks about application status | `tracker` |
| Fills out application form | `apply` |
| Searches for new offers | `scan` |
| Processes pending URLs | `pipeline` |
| Batch processes offers | `batch` |
| Asks about rejection patterns or wants to improve targeting | `patterns` |
| Asks about follow-ups or application cadence | `followup` |
| Wants to update the system | `update` |

### CV Source of Truth

- `cv.md` in project root is the canonical CV
- `article-digest.md` has detailed proof points (optional)
- **NEVER hardcode metrics** -- read them from these files at evaluation time

---

## Ethical Use -- CRITICAL

**This system is designed for quality, not quantity.** The goal is to help the user find and apply to roles where there is a genuine match -- not to spam companies with mass applications.

- **NEVER submit an application without the user reviewing it first.** Fill forms, draft answers, generate PDFs -- but always STOP before clicking Submit/Send/Apply. The user makes the final call.
- **Strongly discourage low-fit applications.** If a score is below 4.0/5, explicitly recommend against applying. The user's time and the recruiter's time are both valuable. Only proceed if the user has a specific reason to override the score.
- **Quality over speed.** A well-targeted application to 5 companies beats a generic blast to 50. Guide the user toward fewer, better applications.
- **Respect recruiters' time.** Every application a human reads costs someone's attention. Only send what's worth reading.

---

## Offer Verification -- MANDATORY

**NEVER trust WebSearch/WebFetch to verify if an offer is still active.** ALWAYS use Playwright:
1. `browser_navigate` to the URL
2. `browser_snapshot` to read content
3. Only footer/navbar without JD = closed. Title + description + Apply = active.

**Exception for batch workers (headless mode):** Playwright is not available in headless pipe mode. Use WebFetch as fallback and mark the report header with `**Verification:** unconfirmed (batch mode)`. The user can verify manually later.

---

## CI/CD and Quality

- **GitHub Actions** run on every PR: `test-all.mjs` (63+ checks), auto-labeler (risk-based: 🔴 core-architecture, ⚠️ agent-behavior, 📄 docs), welcome bot for first-time contributors
- **Branch protection** on `main`: status checks must pass before merge. No direct pushes to main (except admin bypass).
- **Dependabot** monitors npm, Go modules, and GitHub Actions for security updates
- **Contributing process**: issue first → discussion → PR with linked issue → CI passes → maintainer review → merge

## Community and Governance

- **Code of Conduct**: Contributor Covenant 2.1 with enforcement actions (see `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`)
- **Governance**: BDFL model with contributor ladder — Participant → Contributor → Triager → Reviewer → Maintainer (see `GOVERNANCE.md`)
- **Security**: private vulnerability reporting via email (see `SECURITY.md`)
- **Support**: help questions go to Discord/Discussions, not issues (see `SUPPORT.md`)
- **Discord**: https://discord.gg/8pRpHETxa4

## Headless / Batch Mode

When spawning headless workers for batch processing, use the appropriate command for your CLI:

| CLI | Command |
|-----|---------|
| Claude Code | `claude -p "prompt"` |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini -p "prompt"` |
| Copilot CLI | `copilot -p "prompt"` |
| Codex | `codex exec "prompt"` |
| OpenCode | `opencode run "prompt"` |
| Qwen | `qwen -p "prompt"` |

## Stack and Conventions

- Node.js (mjs modules), Playwright (PDF + scraping), YAML (config), HTML/CSS (template), Markdown (data), Canva MCP (optional visual CV)
- Scripts in `.mjs`, configuration in YAML
- Output in `output/` (gitignored), Reports in `reports/`
- JDs in `jds/` (referenced as `local:jds/{file}` in pipeline.md)
- Batch in `batch/` (gitignored except scripts and prompt)
- Report numbering: sequential 3-digit zero-padded, max existing + 1
- **RULE: After each batch of evaluations, run `node merge-tracker.mjs`** to merge tracker additions and avoid duplications.
- **RULE: NEVER create new entries in applications.md if company+role already exists.** Update the existing entry.

### TSV Format for Tracker Additions

Write one TSV file per evaluation to `batch/tracker-additions/{num}-{company-slug}.tsv`. Single line, 9 tab-separated columns:

```
{num}\t{date}\t{company}\t{role}\t{status}\t{score}/5\t{pdf_emoji}\t[{num}](reports/{num}-{slug}-{date}.md)\t{note}
```

**Column order (IMPORTANT -- status BEFORE score):**
1. `num` -- sequential number (integer)
2. `date` -- YYYY-MM-DD
3. `company` -- short company name
4. `role` -- job title
5. `status` -- canonical status (e.g., `Evaluated`)
6. `score` -- format `X.X/5` (e.g., `4.2/5`)
7. `pdf` -- `✅` or `❌`
8. `report` -- markdown link `[num](reports/...)`
9. `notes` -- one-line summary

**Note:** In applications.md, score comes BEFORE status. The merge script handles this column swap automatically.

### Pipeline Integrity

1. **NEVER edit applications.md to ADD new entries** -- Write TSV in `batch/tracker-additions/` and `merge-tracker.mjs` handles the merge.
2. **YES you can edit applications.md to UPDATE status/notes of existing entries.**
3. All reports MUST include `**URL:**` in the header (between Score and PDF). Include `**Legitimacy:** {tier}` (see Block G in `modes/oferta.md`).
4. All statuses MUST be canonical (see `templates/states.yml`).
5. Health check: `node verify-pipeline.mjs`
6. Normalize statuses: `node normalize-statuses.mjs`
7. Dedup: `node dedup-tracker.mjs`

### Canonical States (applications.md)

**Source of truth:** `templates/states.yml`

| State | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `Evaluated` | Report completed, pending decision |
| `Applied` | Application sent |
| `Responded` | Company responded |
| `Interview` | In interview process |
| `Offer` | Offer received |
| `Rejected` | Rejected by company |
| `Discarded` | Discarded by candidate or offer closed |
| `SKIP` | Doesn't fit, don't apply |

**RULES:**
- No markdown bold (`**`) in status field
- No dates in status field (use the date column)
- No extra text (use the notes column)

<!-- OBSIDIAN_SECOND_BRAIN_START -->
# Obsidian Second Brain - Required Preflight

Primary vault: `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault`
Repository: `/Users/paulopierrondi/Projects/career-ops`

This repository is part of Paulo's Obsidian second brain. For AI coding agents, this is a required workflow, not optional context.

## User Profile Snapshot

- Paulo is a ServiceNow Technical Account Executive focused on Banco Bradesco / FSI Brazil, working with Rodrigo Rezende, Joao Saes, Impact and CEG/Services.
- Core enterprise themes: Bradesco strategy, CMDB/CSDM, Now Assist/AI Agents, governance, operating model, FSI positioning and 2026 roadmap.
- Top-of-mind projects include `pptx-engine`, autonomous Claude Code agents, `exploratorio`, `investcoach_ai`, Now Assist Bradesco Operating Model and side-project monetization/IP.
- Style: direct, executive, dense, structured, copy-paste ready, no fluff or motivational tone; PT-BR for Brazil-facing content; honest analytical pushback is welcome.
- For Bradesco Now Assist content, always connect operating model -> adoption velocity -> revenue expansion.

## Agent Hub Enforcement

Before local work with terminal, patch, automation, release, ads, App Store, Linear, secrets or production, run:

```bash
/Users/paulopierrondi/agents-hub/scripts/agent-preflight.py --automation manual-codex --surface Codex --risk workspace_write --cwd "$PWD"
```

If the preflight fails or blocks on a human gate, stop and report. The source of truth is registry + scheduler + handoffs + state + health + human gates, not any individual CLI. App Store, ads, deploy/production, Git push/merge, bulk Linear and secrets require Paulo's explicit command. Automations cannot use Claude Sonnet; automated Claude requires an explicit non-Sonnet model or must stay paused.

## Prompt Caching

- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Prompt Caching Workflow Policy.md` before high-token, recurring or multi-agent work.
- Structure prompts with a stable cacheable prefix first: Agent Hub rules, Paulo style, project context, gates, checklists and output schema.
- Put dynamic task delta last: current request, date, live status, diffs, logs, search results and screenshots.
- Never include secrets, `.env` values, cookies, private keys, provider variable dumps or `ROTATE_REQUIRED` values in a cacheable prefix.
- Report `prompt_cache.strategy`, `prefix_version`, nonsecret cache key/tag and `cached_tokens` when the provider exposes it; use `cli-prefix-layout` with null token metrics when a CLI hides telemetry.

## Mandatory Start Gate

Before planning, editing, refactoring, reviewing, or debugging:
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/Home.md` when the local vault is accessible.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Profile/Paulo Pierrondi Profile.md` for Paulo's professional/personal context, response style, ServiceNow/Bradesco context and current priorities.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/02_Projects/Projects Index.md` and the matching project note under `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/02_Projects`.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/03_AI-Chats/AI Chats Index.md` and any matching project AI history note when relevant.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/AI Agent Vault Policy.md`.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Prompt Caching Workflow Policy.md` before building prompts, handoffs, automations, reports or agent contexts.
- For multi-coder, background coder, automation, Antigravity, or work that continues later, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Agent Coder Integration OS.md` and create/update a handoff card under `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/Hub_Agentes/06_Runtime/handoffs`.
- Run `brain-linear-sync` or read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Git Sync Report.md` before choosing work.
- For roadmap, bug, status, priority, release, sprint/cycle, automation, product planning or backlog cleanup, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Git Development Tracking OS.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Project Map.md`, and the matching Linear project/issue through the Linear connector when available.
- Treat the Linear app connector as the live source of truth for projects, issues, statuses, labels, assignees, comments, cycles and project updates. The sync report is local Git metadata only.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/Development Best Practices Hub.md` and relevant platform best-practice notes.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/Project Checklist Hub.md` and the relevant frontend/backend/platform/AI/security checklists.
- For app, site, UI, visual flow, screenshot, iOS, Android or store work, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/App Web Quality Best Practices.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/App Web Preflight Checklist.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/Screenshots Visual QA Checklist.md`, and the relevant web/iOS/Android preflight.
- For iOS/App Store Connect/TestFlight/signing/IAP/APNS work, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/Apple Developer And App Store Connect Inventory.md` and `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/App Store Connect Upload Runbook.md` before asking for IDs, keys, CI values, provider env vars or running an upload.
- For product, monetization, app ideas, revenue, pricing, growth or side-project prioritization, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Product/Product Revenue MOC.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Product/Nightly Opportunity Engine.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Product/App Ideas Revenue Backlog.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Product/App Refinement Backlog.md`, and `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Product/Nightly Opportunity Report.md`.
- For marketing creative, social video, ElevenLabs, subtitles, LinkedIn, Shorts, TikTok, Instagram/Reels or pierrondi.dev work, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/Marketing MOC.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/Pierrondi.dev Creative Video OS.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/ElevenLabs Voice And Subtitle Workflow.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/Social Video Platform Specs 2026.md`, and `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/Creative QA Checklist.md`.
- For Apple Ads / ASA, App Store paid acquisition, ASO, CPP, paid campaigns or app marketing tuning, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/App Marketing Intelligence OS.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/Apple Ads ASA Tuning Runbook.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/App Marketing Metrics Inventory.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/App Marketing Daily Tuning Report.md`, and `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/App Marketing Tuning Backlog.md`.
- For Obsidian, second-brain, vault, agent-memory, MOC or automation improvements, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Second Brain/Second Brain Intelligence Loop.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Second Brain Intelligence Report.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Claude Code Nightly Second Brain Routine.md`, and `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Second Brain/External Source Watchlist.md`.
- For any automation, routine, scheduled job, cron, LaunchAgent, cloud runner or automatic follow-up, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Automation Email Policy.md` and send a completion email to `pierrondi@gmail.com`.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Security And Secrets Policy.md` before touching auth, APIs, env vars, API keys, tokens, deploy or production config.
- For credentials, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Credential Vault Operating Model.md`: the vault stores inventory/references, never real secret values.
- If credentials are in scope for `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Secret Exposure Incident - 2026-05-19.md`, require rotation before use and use Keychain/secret manager/provider env vars, never chat.
- If Paulo uses `/Users/paulopierrondi/.second-brain-secrets.env` for bulk import, treat it as temporary staging outside the vault and delete it through `brain-secret-intake import ... --delete`.
- For Railway projects, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/Railway Secrets Inventory.md` and use `brain-railway-run -- <command>` instead of asking Paulo to paste secrets.
- Read `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` if present. In cloud environments, treat `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and `.brain/CLAUDE_CLOUD_CONTEXT.md` as the available vault snapshot.

## Multi-Agent Compatibility

- `AGENTS.md` is the cross-agent contract for Codex and all local coders.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` and `KIMI.md` must remain operationally equivalent to `AGENTS.md`; do not simplify one file and leave gates out of another.
- Google Antigravity must read both `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md`; if the vault is outside Antigravity Project folders, explicitly add the vault folder or use `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` as the safe snapshot.
- Active Background Coders: Kimi for broad scans/reports, Codex for patch/integration, Claude Code for complex/compliance, Gemini CLI for independent MCP/terminal validation, Google Antigravity for agent-first/browser/worktree/artifact orchestration.
- Cursor Background Agent remains dormant unless Paulo explicitly activates it.

## Hard Gates

- Do not store real secrets in Markdown, Linear, chat, logs, screenshots, commits or email.
- Never ask Paulo to paste API keys, tokens, passwords, cookies, OAuth credentials, private keys or production secrets in chat when a provider env var, Keychain, 1Password/op reference, `brain-secret-intake`, `brain-railway-run` or another secret manager path exists.
- Do not bulk-close, archive, delete, relabel, reassign or move Linear issues without an explicit cleanup proposal and approval.
- Do not push, merge, force-push, deploy, submit to App Store/TestFlight, change paid ads, publish social content, run production migrations, rotate secrets or change production config without Paulo's explicit command.

## Mandatory Finish Gate

After meaningful work:
- Update the matching Obsidian project note with decisions, commands, files changed, risks, deploy state, and next steps.
- Update the handoff card with status, evidence, tests, residual risk and next action when one exists.
- Update Linear when issue reality changes; do not bulk-close/archive/relabel without a cleanup proposal.
- Register screenshot/visual QA evidence paths when visual work changed, or record why screenshots were not captured.
- Register creative/video assets, scriptId/renderId, caption files, platform variants and marketing learnings when relevant.
- If the local vault is not accessible, update `.brain/SESSION_NOTES.md` with durable project knowledge that should later be synced back to Obsidian.
- Never write secrets to Markdown. Redact API keys, tokens, passwords, cookies, OAuth credentials, private keys, and production secrets.
- API keys belong in a secret manager or provider env vars. The vault stores only inventory: env var name, provider, scope, storage location, owner and rotation date.
- Automation runs must send a final email to `pierrondi@gmail.com` with status, summary, updated reports, pending decisions and failures; redact secrets before sending.
- If the session reveals a reusable development lesson, append it to `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/Learning Inbox.md` or run `brain-learn`.
