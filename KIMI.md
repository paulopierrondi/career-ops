## Project Local Council - Required Context

This repo has a local council overlay. It does not replace the global Product Council; it makes the global roles specific to this repo.

Before planning, editing, reviewing, testing, release, automation, Linear, secrets, UI or marketing work, read:

- `.brain/PROJECT_COUNCIL.md`
- relevant `.brain/local-agents/*.md`
- `.brain/HUB_COUNCIL_CONTEXT.md`
- `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
- `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Prompt Caching Workflow Policy.md` when available
- `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md`

Local agents are advisory role contracts, not autonomous permission grants. They inherit all hard gates from Agent Hub, Obsidian, Linear, Automation Email Policy and Security/Secrets policy.

Required local council handoff:

- local agent(s) considered;
- decision or recommendation;
- files/commands/evidence;
- risk and human gate;
- exact next action.
- prompt_cache strategy and cache telemetry when a provider exposes `cached_tokens` or equivalent.

Registry id: `career-ops`.

# Obsidian Second Brain - Required Preflight

Primary vault: `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault`
Repository: `/Users/paulopierrondi/Projects/career-ops`

This repository is part of Paulo's Obsidian second brain. For AI coding agents, this is a required workflow, not optional context.

## User Profile Snapshot

- Paulo is a ServiceNow Technical Account Executive focused on Banco Bradesco / FSI Brazil, working with Rodrigo Rezende, Joao Saes, Impact and CEG/Services.
- Core enterprise themes: Bradesco strategy, CMDB/CSDM, Now Assist/AI Agents, governance, operating model, FSI positioning and 2026 roadmap.
- Top-of-mind projects include `pptx-engine`, autonomous Claude Code agents, `exploratorio`, `investcoach_ai`, Now Assist Bradesco Operating Model and side-project monetization/IP.
- Style: direct, executive, dense, structured, copy-paste ready, no fluff or motivational tone; PT-BR for Brazil-facing content; honest analytical pushback is welcome.
- For Bradesco Now Assist content, always connect operating model -> adoption velocity -> revenue expansion.

## Agent Hub Enforcement

Before local work with terminal, patch, automation, release, ads, App Store, Linear, secrets or production, run:

```bash
/Users/paulopierrondi/agents-hub/scripts/agent-preflight.py --automation manual-codex --surface Codex --risk workspace_write --cwd "$PWD"
```

If the preflight fails or blocks on a human gate, stop and report. The source of truth is registry + scheduler + handoffs + state + health + human gates, not any individual CLI. App Store, ads, deploy/production, Git push/merge, bulk Linear and secrets require Paulo's explicit command. Automations cannot use Claude Sonnet; automated Claude requires an explicit non-Sonnet model or must stay paused.

## Prompt Caching

- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Prompt Caching Workflow Policy.md` before high-token, recurring or multi-agent work.
- Structure prompts with a stable cacheable prefix first: Agent Hub rules, Paulo style, project context, gates, checklists and output schema.
- Put dynamic task delta last: current request, date, live status, diffs, logs, search results and screenshots.
- Never include secrets, `.env` values, cookies, private keys, provider variable dumps or `ROTATE_REQUIRED` values in a cacheable prefix.
- Report `prompt_cache.strategy`, `prefix_version`, nonsecret cache key/tag and `cached_tokens` when the provider exposes it; use `cli-prefix-layout` with null token metrics when a CLI hides telemetry.

## Mandatory Start Gate

Before planning, editing, refactoring, reviewing, or debugging:
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/Home.md` when the local vault is accessible.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Profile/Paulo Pierrondi Profile.md` for Paulo's professional/personal context, response style, ServiceNow/Bradesco context and current priorities.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/02_Projects/Projects Index.md` and the matching project note under `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/02_Projects`.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/03_AI-Chats/AI Chats Index.md` and any matching project AI history note when relevant.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/AI Agent Vault Policy.md`.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Prompt Caching Workflow Policy.md` before building prompts, handoffs, automations, reports or agent contexts.
- For multi-coder, background coder, automation, Antigravity, or work that continues later, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Agent Coder Integration OS.md` and create/update a handoff card under `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/Hub_Agentes/06_Runtime/handoffs`.
- Run `brain-linear-sync` or read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Git Sync Report.md` before choosing work.
- For roadmap, bug, status, priority, release, sprint/cycle, automation, product planning or backlog cleanup, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Git Development Tracking OS.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Linear/Linear Project Map.md`, and the matching Linear project/issue through the Linear connector when available.
- Treat the Linear app connector as the live source of truth for projects, issues, statuses, labels, assignees, comments, cycles and project updates. The sync report is local Git metadata only.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/Development Best Practices Hub.md` and relevant platform best-practice notes.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/Project Checklist Hub.md` and the relevant frontend/backend/platform/AI/security checklists.
- For app, site, UI, visual flow, screenshot, iOS, Android or store work, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/App Web Quality Best Practices.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/App Web Preflight Checklist.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/Screenshots Visual QA Checklist.md`, and the relevant web/iOS/Android preflight.
- For iOS/App Store Connect/TestFlight/signing/IAP/APNS work, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/Apple Developer And App Store Connect Inventory.md` and `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/App Store Connect Upload Runbook.md` before asking for IDs, keys, CI values, provider env vars or running an upload.
- For product, monetization, app ideas, revenue, pricing, growth or side-project prioritization, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Product/Product Revenue MOC.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Product/Nightly Opportunity Engine.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Product/App Ideas Revenue Backlog.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Product/App Refinement Backlog.md`, and `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Product/Nightly Opportunity Report.md`.
- For marketing creative, social video, ElevenLabs, subtitles, LinkedIn, Shorts, TikTok, Instagram/Reels or pierrondi.dev work, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/Marketing MOC.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/Pierrondi.dev Creative Video OS.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/ElevenLabs Voice And Subtitle Workflow.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/Social Video Platform Specs 2026.md`, and `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/Creative QA Checklist.md`.
- For Apple Ads / ASA, App Store paid acquisition, ASO, CPP, paid campaigns or app marketing tuning, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/App Marketing Intelligence OS.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/Apple Ads ASA Tuning Runbook.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/App Marketing Metrics Inventory.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/App Marketing Daily Tuning Report.md`, and `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Marketing/App Marketing Tuning Backlog.md`.
- For Obsidian, second-brain, vault, agent-memory, MOC or automation improvements, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Second Brain/Second Brain Intelligence Loop.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Second Brain Intelligence Report.md`, `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Claude Code Nightly Second Brain Routine.md`, and `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Second Brain/External Source Watchlist.md`.
- For any automation, routine, scheduled job, cron, LaunchAgent, cloud runner or automatic follow-up, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Automation Email Policy.md` and send a completion email to `pierrondi@gmail.com`.
- Read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Security And Secrets Policy.md` before touching auth, APIs, env vars, API keys, tokens, deploy or production config.
- For credentials, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Credential Vault Operating Model.md`: the vault stores inventory/references, never real secret values.
- If credentials are in scope for `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/99_System/Secret Exposure Incident - 2026-05-19.md`, require rotation before use and use Keychain/secret manager/provider env vars, never chat.
- If Paulo uses `/Users/paulopierrondi/.second-brain-secrets.env` for bulk import, treat it as temporary staging outside the vault and delete it through `brain-secret-intake import ... --delete`.
- For Railway projects, read `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Checklists/Railway Secrets Inventory.md` and use `brain-railway-run -- <command>` instead of asking Paulo to paste secrets.
- Read `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` if present. In cloud environments, treat `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and `.brain/CLAUDE_CLOUD_CONTEXT.md` as the available vault snapshot.

## Multi-Agent Compatibility

- `AGENTS.md` is the cross-agent contract for Codex and all local coders.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` and `KIMI.md` must remain operationally equivalent to `AGENTS.md`; do not simplify one file and leave gates out of another.
- Google Antigravity must read both `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md`; if the vault is outside Antigravity Project folders, explicitly add the vault folder or use `.brain/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` as the safe snapshot.
- Active Background Coders: Kimi for broad scans/reports, Codex for patch/integration, Claude Code for complex/compliance, Gemini CLI for independent MCP/terminal validation, Google Antigravity for agent-first/browser/worktree/artifact orchestration.
- Cursor Background Agent remains dormant unless Paulo explicitly activates it.

## Hard Gates

- Do not store real secrets in Markdown, Linear, chat, logs, screenshots, commits or email.
- Never ask Paulo to paste API keys, tokens, passwords, cookies, OAuth credentials, private keys or production secrets in chat when a provider env var, Keychain, 1Password/op reference, `brain-secret-intake`, `brain-railway-run` or another secret manager path exists.
- Do not bulk-close, archive, delete, relabel, reassign or move Linear issues without an explicit cleanup proposal and approval.
- Do not push, merge, force-push, deploy, submit to App Store/TestFlight, change paid ads, publish social content, run production migrations, rotate secrets or change production config without Paulo's explicit command.

## Mandatory Finish Gate

After meaningful work:
- Update the matching Obsidian project note with decisions, commands, files changed, risks, deploy state, and next steps.
- Update the handoff card with status, evidence, tests, residual risk and next action when one exists.
- Update Linear when issue reality changes; do not bulk-close/archive/relabel without a cleanup proposal.
- Register screenshot/visual QA evidence paths when visual work changed, or record why screenshots were not captured.
- Register creative/video assets, scriptId/renderId, caption files, platform variants and marketing learnings when relevant.
- If the local vault is not accessible, update `.brain/SESSION_NOTES.md` with durable project knowledge that should later be synced back to Obsidian.
- Never write secrets to Markdown. Redact API keys, tokens, passwords, cookies, OAuth credentials, private keys, and production secrets.
- API keys belong in a secret manager or provider env vars. The vault stores only inventory: env var name, provider, scope, storage location, owner and rotation date.
- Automation runs must send a final email to `pierrondi@gmail.com` with status, summary, updated reports, pending decisions and failures; redact secrets before sending.
- If the session reveals a reusable development lesson, append it to `/Users/paulopierrondi/Documents/Obsidian Vault/04_Areas/Coding/Best Practices/Learning Inbox.md` or run `brain-learn`.
